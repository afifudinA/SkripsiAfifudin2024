or get the APK from the

### What is TetherFi

TetherFi works by creating a Wi-Fi Direct legacy group and an HTTP proxy server. Other
devices can connect to the broadcasted Wi-Fi network, and connect to the Internet by
setting the proxy server settings to the server created by TetherFi. You do not need a
Hotspot data plan to use TetherFi.

Please note that TetherFi is still a work in progress and not everything will work.
For example, using TetherFi to get an open NAT type on consoles is currently not
possible. General "normal" internet browsing should work fine - however, it is
dependent on the speed and availability of your Android device's internet connection.

To see a list of apps that are known to not work currently, see the
[Wiki](https://github.com/pyamsoft/tetherfi/wiki/Known-Not-Working)

### TetherFi may be for you if:

  has a data cap
- You have an Unlimited Data and a Hotspot plan from your Carrier, but Hotspot
  has throttling
- You do not have a mobile Hotspot plan
- You wish to create a LAN between devices
- Your home router has reached the device connection limit

will never track you, or sell or share your data. TetherFi offers in-app purchases,
